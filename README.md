<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About This Project

The idea to this project actually started a couple of years ago when i saw the list [@stgermain](https://www.playstationtrophies.org/forum/profile/24209-stgermain/) made on PlaystationTrophies.org. But at that time i didnt have a PS Vita or Playstation 3 so i just played PS4 instead. Last year due to Covid-19 i got my hands on both the Vita and PS3 and then i started using his lists but quickly found out that its very outdated. He obviously put alot work into his lists and i thought i would continue in his honor and maybe try to complete the list. This project will include PS Vita, Playstation 3 & 4.

<!-- FAQ -->
## FAQ

### Why was the old project removed and replace with a Remake?:
I recently lost all of my work on my MacBook because of an update and didnt have a backup. So i decided to start over with what i have and try to make it better.
### Why are games with Ad hoc and Co-Op not added?:
I would really like to add both Co-Op and Ad Hoc that can be done offline or with a friend without any Server connection. But to be honest, i don't see this in the near future. There's alot of info to go through and at some point it might be added, but i need a lot more help for that and right now it's not my main priority. But we'll see.
### Why is this project getting updated so slow?:
I have a lot going on in my life right now. Work, personale etc. So i only have my spare time to do this in and there's are a lot of games to go through so it will take some time. I would also like to get an "Test Device" or a modified one so i could test games that don't have enough information about. That's why i hope people will help with this project.
### How come the .xlsx sheet looks like crap?:
Haha! Believe it or not this is actully my first time using Excel so thats why. So if anyone whats to update the look to make it better, then please do ðŸ˜†
### Why am i doing this?:
First of all i would like to pay tribute to [@stgermain](https://www.playstationtrophies.org/forum/profile/24209-stgermain/) for starting it all, and second is that me and my friends do a little trophy hunting, so this would be alot of help to us.
